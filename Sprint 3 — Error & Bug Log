🐞 Sprint 3 — Error & Bug Log

This sprint involved several critical debugging sessions related to Git conflicts, TypeScript errors, API integration issues, and Express routing. The following log documents each major issue, its cause, the steps to reproduce it, and how it was fixed.

🔹 Bug 1 — Git Merge Conflict in src/app.ts
Status: Resolved
Severity: High
Category: Git / Merge Conflict / Build Breaker
Description

During a rebase of feature/generate-notes onto the latest remote branch, src/app.ts failed to merge due to conflicting logic originating from two different feature branches:

One version included logger and updated Express structure

Another version included outdated import paths (e.g., ./app/(app)/api/summarize.router)

Reproduction Steps

Checkout feature/generate-notes

Run:

git pull --rebase origin feature/generate-notes


Observe conflict in src/app.ts

Root Cause

Multiple branches edited the same file section (imports + router mounting) without synchronized updates. When rebasing, Git attempted to apply both histories, which generated invalid syntax, unclosed comment blocks, and duplicated imports.

Fix Applied

Conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) were manually removed.

All imports were corrected to use the actual project structure:

import summarizeRouter from './app/api/summarize.router';
import logger from './lib/logger';


Ensured all comment blocks were terminated properly.

Rebuilt the application locally to confirm no syntax errors remained.

Rebasing continued and branch force-pushed:

git add src/app.ts
git rebase --continue
git push origin feature/generate-notes --force

Verification

App compiled without TypeScript errors

Express server booted correctly

Request logging worked

All integration tests passed

🔹 Bug 2 — TypeScript Error: “Invalid character” & Missing Property
Status: Resolved
Severity: Medium
Category: TypeScript / AI API Integration
Description

Inside summarize.router.ts, TypeScript threw:

TS1127: Invalid character.
TS2339: Property 'outputText' does not exist on type GenerateResponse.

Reproduction Steps

Open the file

Attempt to build or simply let VSCode's TypeScript server analyze it

The invalid character appears because of a stray closing comment followed by code:

*/
import summarizeRouter ...

Root Cause

A comment block was closed incorrectly, causing TS to treat the next line as invalid.

The correct property from Genkit’s response object is outputText, but earlier code incorrectly used output_text() as a function.

Fix Applied

Removed stray comment block characters.

Corrected the AI output extraction:

const text = response.outputText ?? "No schedule could be generated.";

Verification

TypeScript error list is empty

Feature runs correctly

Generated schedules appear normally in frontend

Integration tests referencing schedule endpoint pass

🔹 Bug 3 — CI Failure: Missing Bracket in app.ts
Status: Resolved
Severity: High
Category: Syntax / Build Breaker / CI Test Failure
Description

CI pipeline reported:

TS1005: '}' expected.

Root Cause

A merge left an unbalanced set of brackets inside the createApp() function. Local builds didn’t show it until Jest integration tests executed in CI.

Fix Applied

Reconstructed the closing brackets for:

Express error handler

createApp() function

Re-indented code to visually confirm matching braces.

Verification

CI passed all tests

Local build succeeded

App boots normally

🔹 Bug 4 — Non-Fast-Forward Push Rejections
Status: Resolved
Severity: Medium
Category: Git Workflow
Description

git push rejected:

! [rejected] non-fast-forward

Root Cause

Local branch was behind remote history after teammates’ commits.

Fix Applied

Rebased properly with conflict resolution:

git pull --rebase origin feature/generate-notes
git push origin feature/generate-notes --force

Verification

Branch now matches remote exactly

PR shows correct updated commit history

🔹 Bug 5 — Incorrect Import Path in Older Branch
Status: Resolved
Severity: Low
Category: Project Structure / API Routing
Description

Old code referenced:

import summarizeRouter from './app/(app)/api/summarize.router';

Root Cause

Project structure was refactored to:

src/app/api/

Fix Applied

Updated import in all files to the correct path.

Verification

No module resolution errors remained.
